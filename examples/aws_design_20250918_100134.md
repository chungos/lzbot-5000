## Executive Summary

This design provides a robust, scalable AWS CloudWAN architecture spanning Melbourne and Sydney regions with centralized packet inspection, decentralized egress, and centralized ingress capabilities. The architecture follows all five pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

## Detailed Architecture Design

### 1. Global Network Layer (CloudWAN Core)

**AWS CloudWAN Implementation:**
- **Core Network**: Single global network managed centrally
- **Network Segments**: Separate segments for Sydney and Melbourne with policy-based routing
- **Attachment Types**: VPC attachments, Transit Gateway attachments
- **Policy-Based Routing**: Centralized route policies for traffic steering

**Well-Architected Justification:**
- **Operational Excellence**: Centralized network management and policies
- **Security**: Segmented network with policy-based access controls
- **Reliability**: Multi-region architecture with automatic failover
- **Performance**: Optimized routing via AWS backbone
- **Cost Optimization**: Consolidated data transfer pricing

### 2. Regional Architecture Components
