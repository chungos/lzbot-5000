## **Core Architecture Components**

### **1. Global Layer (Centralized Ingress)**

**CloudFront Distribution**
```
Purpose: Global content delivery and DDoS protection
Configuration:
- Origin: Application Load Balancers in both regions
- Price Class: Use Only US, Canada, Europe, Asia, Middle East and Africa
- Security: WAF integration, SSL/TLS termination
- Caching: Static content cached at edge locations
```

**AWS WAF**
```
Rules Configuration:
- Rate limiting: 2000 requests per 5 minutes per IP
- Geo-blocking: Block traffic from high-risk countries
- SQL injection and XSS protection
- IP reputation filtering
```

**Route 53**
```
DNS Configuration:
- Health checks on ALBs in both regions
- Geolocation-based routing (Australia â†’ closest region)
- Latency-based routing for optimal performance
- Failover routing for disaster recovery
```

### **2. AWS Cloud WAN Core Network**

**Core Network Configuration**
```yaml
Core Network Policy:
  Segments:
    - Production (isolated, encrypted)
    - Development (isolated)
    - Shared Services (controlled access)
  
  Routing Policies:
    Production:
      - East-West: Allow between regions
      - Inspection: Force through Network Firewall
      - Egress: Route to local NAT Gateway
    
    Shared Services:
      - Access: Controlled via security groups
      - Services: AD, DNS, Endpoints
```

### **3. Regional Architecture (Melbourne & Sydney)**

#### **Network Segmentation per Region**

**Inspection VPC (10.X.0.0/16)**
```
Subnets:
- Firewall Subnet A: 10.X.1.0/24 (AZ-a)
- Firewall Subnet B: 10.X.2.0/24 (AZ-b)

AWS Network Firewall Rules:
- Allow HTTPS (443) outbound
- Block P2P protocols
- IPS/IDS for threat detection  
- Domain filtering for malware protection
```

**Production VPC (10.X.100.0/16)**
```
Subnets:
- Public Subnet A: 10.X.101.0/24 (AZ-a) - ALB only
- Public Subnet B: 10.X.102.0/24 (AZ-b) - ALB only  
- Private Subnet A: 10.X.111.0/24 (AZ-a) - App tier
- Private Subnet B: 10.X.112.0/24 (AZ-b) - App tier
- Database Subnet A: 10.X.121.0/24 (AZ-a)
- Database Subnet B: 10.X.122.0/24 (AZ-b)
```

**Shared Services VPC (10.X.200.0/16)**
```
Services:
- AWS Managed Microsoft AD
- VPC Endpoints (S3, DynamoDB, SSM, etc.)
- DNS resolvers
- Centralized logging
```

**Egress VPC (10.X.50.0/16)**
```
Purpose: Decentralized internet egress per region
Components:
- NAT Gateway in each AZ
- Internet Gateway
- Route tables for outbound traffic
```

### **4. Security Architecture**

#### **Centralized Packet Inspection**
```
Implementation:
- All inter-VPC traffic routed through Network Firewall
- Stateful firewall rules with deep packet inspection
- Integration with AWS Firewall Manager for policy management
- Automated threat feed updates
```

#### **Identity and Access Management**
```
AWS Organizations Structure:
- Root OU
  â”œâ”€â”€ Security OU (logging, monitoring accounts)
  â”œâ”€â”€ Production OU (prod workloads)
  â”œâ”€â”€ Development OU (dev/test workloads)
  â””â”€â”€ Shared Services OU (networking, AD)

Service Control Policies (SCPs):
- Restrict region usage to ap-southeast-2 and ap-southeast-4
- Prevent root account usage
- Enforce encryption requirements
- Block public S3 buckets
```

### **5. Monitoring and Logging**

```
Centralized Logging:
- VPC Flow Logs â†’ CloudWatch Logs
- Network Firewall Logs â†’ S3 + CloudWatch
- Application Logs â†’ CloudWatch Logs
- Security events â†’ Security Hub

Monitoring:
- CloudWatch custom metrics for application KPIs
- GuardDuty for threat detection
- Config for compliance monitoring
- Personal Health Dashboard for service health
```

### **6. Cost Optimization Strategy**

#### **Data Transfer Cost Minimization**
```
Decentralized Egress:
- Melbourne region: Local NAT Gateway for Australia internet traffic
- Sydney region: Local NAT Gateway for Australia internet traffic
- Estimated savings: 40-60% on data transfer costs

Traffic Optimization:
- CloudFront caching reduces origin requests by ~80%
- VPC Endpoints eliminate NAT Gateway charges for AWS services
- Cross-region traffic kept within Cloud WAN (free)
```

#### **Resource Right-Sizing**
```
Auto Scaling Policies:
- Scale out at 70% CPU utilization
- Scale in at 30% CPU utilization
- Schedule-based scaling for predictable workloads

Database Optimization:
- RDS Multi-AZ in primary region (Melbourne)
- Read replicas in Sydney for read-heavy workloads
- Automated backups with lifecycle policies
```
