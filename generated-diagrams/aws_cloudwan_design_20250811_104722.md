## Design Details and Implementation Guide

I apologize for the diagram generation issues. Let me provide you with the comprehensive textual design instead, and I'll describe the diagram layout clearly so you can visualize or recreate it.

## **AWS Cloud WAN Multi-Region Architecture Design**

### **Architecture Overview**

This design implements a Well-Architected AWS Cloud WAN solution spanning Melbourne and Sydney regions with centralized packet inspection, decentralized egress, and centralized ingress for optimal performance, security, and cost efficiency.

## **Detailed Architecture Components**

### **1. Global Network Foundation (Reliability + Performance Efficiency)**

**AWS Cloud WAN Core Network**
- **Global Network**: Single managed global network spanning both regions
- **Core Network Policy**: JSON-based policy defining routing, segmentation, and attachments
- **Regions**: ap-southeast-4 (Melbourne), ap-southeast-2 (Sydney)
- **BGP ASN**: Private ASN for routing control

**Benefits**: 
- Simplified network management
- Automatic propagation of routes
- Built-in redundancy and failover
- Predictable network performance

### **2. Account Structure (Security + Operational Excellence)**

```
Organization Root
├── Core Accounts OU
│   ├── Network Hub Account (Cloud WAN, inspection services)
│   ├── Security Account (GuardDuty, Security Hub, logging)
│   └── Shared Services Account (DNS, monitoring)
├── Production OU
│   ├── Melbourne Production Account
│   └── Sydney Production Account
└── Management OU
    └── Master Account (billing, organizations)
```

### **3. Regional Hub Architecture**

#### **Melbourne Region (ap-southeast-4)**

**Hub VPC (10.10.0.0/16)**
- **Public Subnets**: 10.10.1.0/24, 10.10.2.0/24 (AZ-a, AZ-b)

```
Production VPC → Network Firewall (Inspection) → Hub VPC → Internet/Cloud WAN
```

### **6. Decentralized Egress (Cost Optimization)**

**NAT Gateway Strategy**:

- **Regional Internet Gateways**: Direct internet access per region
- **Cost Optimization**: Eliminates cross-region data transfer charges

**Benefits**:

**Network Security**:
- **Security Groups**: Stateful firewalls
- **NACLs**: Network-level access control
- **Network Firewall**: Deep packet inspection
- **Private Subnets**: No direct internet access

### **8. Monitoring & Observability (Operational Excellence)**

**Logging Strategy**:
- **Centralized Logging**: All logs to shared services account
- **Log Groups**: Organized by service and region
- **Log Retention**: Compliance-based retention policies

**Monitoring**:
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Infrastructure and application metrics
- **Custom Dashboards**: Region-specific and global views
- **Alarms**: Automated alerting for critical events

**Performance Monitoring**:
- **Network Performance**: Cloud WAN metrics
- **Application Performance**: ALB and target metrics
- **Database Performance**: RDS Performance Insights

## **Traffic Flow Patterns**

### **Inbound Traffic (Centralized)**
1. Global users → Route 53 (DNS resolution)
2. Route 53 → CloudFront (CDN and caching)
3. CloudFront → AWS WAF (security filtering)
4. AWS WAF → Regional ALBs (load balancing)
5. ALBs → Production application servers

### **Inter-Region Communication**
1. Melbourne apps → Cloud WAN → Sydney apps
2. Traffic inspected at Network Firewall in each region
3. Optimized routing via Cloud WAN backbone

### **Outbound Traffic (Decentralized)**
1. Production apps → Network Firewall (inspection)
2. Network Firewall → Hub VPC → NAT Gateway
3. NAT Gateway → Internet Gateway → Internet

### **East-West Traffic**
1. All inter-VPC communication via Cloud WAN
2. Mandatory inspection at Network Firewall
3. Centralized logging and monitoring
