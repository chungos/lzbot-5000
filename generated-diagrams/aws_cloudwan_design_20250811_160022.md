### Architecture Overview

This design delivers a robust, scalable AWS Cloud WAN solution for Melbourne (ap-southeast-2) and Sydney (ap-southeast-4) regions that meets all your requirements while adhering to the AWS Well-Architected Framework principles.

### Key Architecture Components

#### 1. **AWS Cloud WAN Core Network**
- **Centralized Global Network**: Single pane of glass for managing multi-region connectivity
- **Segmented Architecture**: Separate network segments for production, development, and shared services
- **Policy-Based Routing**: Automated routing decisions based on network segments and policies

#### 2. **Centralized Packet Inspection** *(Security Pillar)*
- **AWS Network Firewall** in dedicated Security VPCs in both regions
- **Gateway Load Balancer** for transparent traffic inspection
- **Centralized inspection** for all East-West and North-South traffic
- **Threat intelligence** and intrusion detection capabilities

#### 3. **Decentralized Egress** *(Cost Optimization + Performance Pillar)*
- **Region-specific NAT Gateways** in each region's Shared Services VPC
- **Reduces data transfer costs** by avoiding cross-region internet traffic
- **Improves latency** for outbound connections
- **High availability** with multi-AZ NAT Gateway deployment

#### 4. **Centralized Ingress** *(Performance + Security Pillar)*
- **Amazon CloudFront** as global CDN and ingress point
- **AWS WAF** for application-layer protection
- **AWS Shield Advanced** for DDoS protection
- **Route 53** for intelligent DNS routing and health checks

### Network Segmentation Strategy

#### **Production Segment**
- Isolated routing domain for production workloads
- Cross-region connectivity for disaster recovery
- Strict security policies and monitoring

#### **Development Segment**
- Separate network segment for dev/test environments
- Cost-optimized with shared resources
- Relaxed but secure policies for development workflows

#### **Shared Services Segment**
- Centralized services like DNS, Active Directory, and monitoring
- Available to all other segments through controlled routing
- Optimized for cost and operational efficiency

### Regional Architecture Details

#### **Melbourne Region (ap-southeast-2)**
1. **Security Inspection VPC** (10.0.0.0/16)
   - AWS Network Firewall with custom rules
   - Gateway Load Balancer endpoints
   - Transit Gateway for traffic routing

2. **Shared Services VPC** (10.0.16.0/16)
   - Route 53 Resolver for DNS
   - AWS Managed Microsoft AD
   - NAT Gateways for internet access
   - Monitoring and logging services

3. **Production VPC** (10.0.32.0/16)
   - Application Load Balancers
   - EC2 instances in multiple AZs
   - RDS clusters with Multi-AZ deployment

4. **Non-Production VPC** (10.0.48.0/16)
   - Development and testing workloads
   - Cost-optimized instance types
   - Development databases

#### **Sydney Region (ap-southeast-4)**
1. **Security Inspection VPC** (10.1.0.0/16)
   - Mirror of Melbourne security setup
   - Regional threat detection

2. **Shared Services VPC** (10.1.16.0/16)
   - Regional DNS resolution
   - AD replica for local authentication
   - Regional NAT Gateways

3. **Production VPC** (10.1.32.0/16)
   - Production workloads
   - Regional database clusters

4. **Disaster Recovery VPC** (10.1.48.0/16)
   - Cross-region RDS replicas
   - Standby applications for failover

### Security & Governance Framework

#### **Multi-Account Strategy** *(Security + Operational Excellence)*
```
├── Management Account (Billing & Organizations)
├── Log Archive Account (Centralized Logging)
├── Audit Account (Security Tools)
├── Production OU
│   ├── Prod Melbourne Account
│   └── Prod Sydney Account
├── Non-Production OU
│   ├── Development Account
│   └── Test Account
└── Security OU
    ├── Security Account
    └── Network Account
```

#### **Security Controls Implementation**
